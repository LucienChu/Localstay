          <p>Our three different plans are built so that every homeowner can benefit from flexible lettings. But which is right for you? We look at each Hostmaker plan carefully and why clients prefer Fixed, Flex or Pro, and how it answers their needs.
            <br>The Hostmaker Fixed plan is great for landlords who are chiefly concerned with stable returns: typically, we see clients with high-value homes in more central locations preferring this solution, as it guarantees a high level of guaranteed revenue. This plan is criteria based on location and property suitability so ask our talented account managers which would best suit.
            <br>The Hostmaker Flex plan is our most popular, and is adopted by a wide range of landlords and homeowners.
            <br>The Hostmaker Pro plan is especially crafted for organisations who deal with large real estate portfolios, such as institutions, family offices, portfolio owners and other property asset management firms.
